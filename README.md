# Project1-Game

## Games for Children with Autism
The idea is to build a game center that contains 3 games suitable for children with autism in order to foster their independent skills since these games will focus on things they don't usually pay attention to.

## Game 1: Make an Ice-cream
The child should select the choices that the bear is looking at in order to serve the ice-cream he wants and finish the game succesfully. 
There is no win or lose in this game, however, the child will learn to make better eye contact.
Everytime the child select a wrong choice, the correct option will have some additional styles as a hint.


## Game 2: Help in Painting
The kid will challange him/herself to pick and catch the colors specefied by Lilly in order to use them in her drawing. 
The kid have 3 lifes to make this happen and win.
This will help them focus on moving objects and understand colors more.

## Game 3: Emotions Expressions
A list of emotions will be given and the child is challenged to answer them by sellecting the right expression card.
On each each correct selection, the score will increase; and in wrong answers, the correct card will be highlighted.
At the end, score will be given out of 8.
